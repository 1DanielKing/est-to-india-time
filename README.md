## app details

This app shall convert from eastern time to indian time.

I now realize I should have broken it down into steps and this would also be a good opportunity to use Sprint or Waterfall management styles and have first implemented a most basic version which assumes the user will enter everything perfectly in 12 hour clock format. Instead I have gone directly to ask user if it is AM PM or 24 hour clock. This would then have later effects on how the math logic is applied. The math logic would probably be best to convert to 24 hour then convert back to AM/PM or give back 24 hour. Also I would have to have logic to change the hour after 60 minutes and return remainder that is over 60 to the minutes.
